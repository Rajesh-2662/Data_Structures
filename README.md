# Data Structures: Linked List, Double Linked List, and Binary Search Tree

This repository contains implementations of three fundamental data structures: Linked List, Double Linked List, and Binary Search Tree. These data structures are commonly used in computer science and provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data.

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays, but have slower access times.

### Features

- Creation of a singly linked list
- Insertion of a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position
- Deletion of a node from the list
- Searching for a node in the list
- Displaying the list's contents

## Double Linked List

A double linked list is similar to a linked list but provides bidirectional traversal. Each node contains data as well as references to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence. This allows for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions.

### Features

- Creation of a double linked list
- Insertion of a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position
- Deletion of a node from the list
- Searching for a node in the list
- Displaying the list's contents

## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure with the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.

BSTs provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them suitable for tasks like sorting, searching, and maintaining ordered data.

### Features

- Creation of a binary search tree
- Insertion of a node with a given key
- Deletion of a node with a given key
- Searching for a node with a given key
- Traversing the tree in preorder, inorder, and postorder

## Getting Started

To use the Linked List, Double Linked List, and Binary Search Tree implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
